As a person who likes to read books as a hobby, I find it helpful for me to track my reading habits to stay aware of my progress.

To achieve this, I decided to design and create a simple CRUD application with a straightforward UI, serving both as a tool for tracking,
but mainly as a project for self-practice to enhance the skills I want to continuously build and focus on.

In this project, I am using C# and ASP.NET Core, along with Repository and Clean architecture principles for the backend development.
For the frontend, I am utilizing React as the UI library.

This is an ongoing project, and if you have any helpful insights, please feel free to check my overview page or reach out to me via email.
